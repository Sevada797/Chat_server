<h2>About the project</h2>

This is my created php real-time chat,
I've created iframe wich reloads itself
every 1.5 seconds and that's how it's
real life xD
Idk if there are this kind of chats
but this was my idea and I
just wanted to do something
fun.

<h2>How to use</h2>

Ok now how to use it, just download or clone the repository
after what simply run it on a server, for ex. I runned in ngrok.
And then when your client visits the website
you can chat with him/her by overwriting and
saving admin.txt, and if he/she typed you a message
you'll see it in your chat.txt, ( advice simply keep them both opened and enjoy the chat)) )
